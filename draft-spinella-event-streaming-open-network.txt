1.  Introduction

   According to Urquhart (Urquhart, 2021), Event Streaming plays a key
   role in how the economic system evolves.  Society is rapidly
   digitalizing and automating the exchanges of value that constitute
   the economy.  Also, considerable time and energy is spent to assure
   that key transactions can be executed with reduced human involvement
   with better, faster, and more accurate results.

   However, most of the integrations executed today across
   organizational boundaries are not in real time and they currently
   require employing mostly proprietary formats and protocols.  On the
   other hand, some industries have adopted data formats for exchanging
   information between organizations, such as Electronic Data
   Interchange (EDI).  However, those integrations are limited to
   specific use cases and represent a small fraction of all needed
   organizational integrations.

   Even when application programming interfaces exist for event
   streaming, these are largely proprietary.  For instance, Twitter
   offers an API for consuming social media streams, but it is not
   implemented by other parties.  Thus, there is no consistent and
   common consensus on a mechanism for the exchange of events across
   organizations.  This results in a completely custom landscape for
   real-time cross-organization integration.  In this scenario,
   development teams must invest plenty of time into understanding and
   defining a common interface for data exchange.

   In this context, we can now introduce how this landscape would
   radically change with the adoption of an Event Streaming Open
   Network.  When needing to integrate real-time information across
   organizations, developers would have a common basis for finding,
   publishing, and subscribing to event streams.  Also, given a set of
   standard formats to encode and transmit events, developers could use
   the programming language of their choice.

   Overall, this set of standards would drastically reduce the cost of
   real-time integration, which would also enable experimentation by
   users.  This experimentation can create an innovation space for new
   uses of event streaming.
